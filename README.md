# ARIMA-bootstrap-imputation
This project was develoepd for the Kapita Selekta Statistika II course in college by a team of four members. It focuses on generating predictions using the ARIMA model combined with moving block bootstrap (MBB) to enhance the robustness of the forecasts through resampling. The implementation is carried out in MATLAB, featuring a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) designed for ARIMA-based forecasting.

The GUI offers an intuitive experiencce, allowing users to easily input their time series data, select relevant parameters, and choose their preferred imputation method for handling missing values. The final output not only presents the forecast results but also visualizes the predicted values alongside the original data, providing users with clearer insights into the model's performance.

Here is an example of the GUI in use.
